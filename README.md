# Bank-Management  
This is my first OOP project.  
I'm still on basic level.  
This will be updated as I learn new things.  

Version 0.1  
Features:  
$ You can register new accounts and exit application,data will not be lost  
$ all data is stored in a database.txt file  
$ passwords are stored using a hash function, so retrieving user passwords from database.txt is prevented  
$ after login there are four features- withdraw,deposit,show balance and change password  
$ Corner cases from user input are still not handled,I will update it later
